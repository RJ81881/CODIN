 <h1 >Overview of C Language</h1>
 <p>C is a structured programming language developed by Dennis Ritchie and is known as the 
founder of C language, It was developed to overcome the problems of previous languages such as 
B,BCPL, etc. C language was developed to write the UNIX operating system, hence it is strongly 
associated with UNIX, which is one of the most popular network operating system in use today.
</p><br>
 <h1>History of C language</h1>
 <p>C language has evolved from three different structured language ALGOL, BCPL and B Language. 
It uses many concepts from these languages while introduced many new concepts such as 
datatypes, struct, pointer etc.In 1990, a version of C language was approved by the International 
Standard Organisation(ISO) and that version of C is also referred to as C89</p>
 <br>
 
  <h1>Why C Language is so popular?</h1>
<p>C language is a very good language to introduce yourself to the programming world, as it is a 
simple language which is capable of doing wonders.
Programs written in C language takes very less time to execute and almost executes at the speed of 
assembly language instructions.
Initially C language was mainly used for writing system level programs, like designing operating 
systems, but there are other applications as well which can be very well designed and developed 
using C language, like Text Editors, Compilers, Network Drivers etc.
</p><br>
<h1>Latest Version of C</h1>
<p>The current latest version of C language is C11, which was introduced in 2011. It is supported by 
all the standard C language compilers.
Many new features have been introduced in this version and an overall attempt to improve 
compatibility of the C language with C++ language has been made. We will learn about the C11 
edition, once we are done with learning C language, towards the end of this tutorial series.</p>
